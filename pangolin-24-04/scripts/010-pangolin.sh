Welcome to your Pangolin server! This guide will help you get started.

## What is Pangolin?

Pangolin is a self-hosted tunneled mesh reverse proxy server with identity and access control, designed to securely expose private resources on distributed networks. It connects isolated networks through encrypted tunnels, enabling easy access to remote services without opening ports.

## Key Features

- Expose private resources without opening ports (firewall punching)
- Secure site-to-site connectivity via WireGuard tunnels
- Automated SSL certificates via LetsEncrypt
- Support for HTTP/HTTPS and raw TCP/UDP services
- Centralized authentication system
- Role-based access control

## Getting Started

1. When you first log in, the setup script will guide you through the initial configuration.
2. Make sure your domain is pointing to this server's IP address before running the setup.
3. After completing the setup, you can access the Pangolin dashboard at `https://your-domain.com`.
